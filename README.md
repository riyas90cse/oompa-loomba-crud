### Requriement Specification
Hi!
Our team here at Napptilus Tech Labs just received a requirement to develop a website to manage the ​ Oompa Loompa ​ 's crew of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. Some
kind of help to the company’s Human Resources dpt. (they are very modern in some aspects and they have smartphones and access to the Internet, for instance).
However, we need you to help Willy Wonka to code a server that provides a tool to manage all Oompa Loompas.

### Each Oompa Loompa owns the following information:
- Name
- Age
- Job
- Height
- Weight
- Description
  
### The server must fulfill the following API features:
- Get the list of Oompa Loompas. For that list, only name, age and job are required per
  Oompa Looma.
- Get the full detail of an Oompa Loompa
- Add a new Oompa Loompa
- Edit a current Oompa Loompa
  Specifications:
- Use Spring Boot framework
- Use as many third party libraries as you want but, please, document all libraries you
  have used and explain the reason why you’ve used them.
- Use docker
- Use either Couchbase, MongoDB or MySql for your database
  
### Bonus:
- Be creative!
- Error handling
- Response caching
- Hystrix/Resilience4j usage
- RxJava/reactor usage
- Paginate the list of Oompa Loompas
- Fork your repo and use a different database
  This test is aimed at knowing how you code a server, the technical decisions you take along
  the process and the overall cleanliness of your code. ​ Happy coding! Please share a Github
  repository with us or just send a Zip file.
